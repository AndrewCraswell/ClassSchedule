The scripts in this folder were created for the purpose of copying data from the old (v2)
ClassSchedule database schema to the new (v3) normalized version.

NOTE: These scripts expect the local server to be linked to our Test/QA server,
which currently contains a copy of the database (and data) from production. IF
PRODUCTION DATA EXISTS ON A DIFFERENT SERVER, MODIFY THESE SCRIPTS ACCORDINGLY.
